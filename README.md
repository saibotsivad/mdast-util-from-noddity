# micromark-extension-noddity

[Micromark](https://github.com/micromark/micromark) and [mdast](https://github.com/syntax-tree/mdast) extension to parse [noddity](http://noddity.com/) flavored markdown.

This package does not resolve Noddity links or anything, it just parses the markdown to a tree.

## Install

This package is ESM only.

Install the usual ways:

```bash
npm install micromark-extension-noddity
```

## Use

Say we have the following markdown file `example.md`:

```md
This is an [[file.md|internal link]] to a file. Here is a ::template.md|cars|wheels=2:: with variables.
```

...and our module `example.js` looks as follows:

```js
import { readFile } from 'node:fs/promises'
import { fromMarkdown } from 'mdast-util-from-markdown'
import { micromarkFromNoddity, mdastFromNoddity } from 'micromark-extension-noddity'

const string = await readFile('example.md', 'utf8')
const tree = fromMarkdown(string, {
	extensions: [ micromarkFromNoddity() ],
	mdastExtensions: [ mdastFromNoddity() ],
})

console.log(tree)
```

â€¦now running node `example.js` yields (positional info removed for brevity):

```json
{
	"type": "root",
	"children": [
		{
			"type": "text",
			"value": "This is an "
		},
		{
			"type": "noddityLink",
			"file": "file.md",
			"text": "internal link"
		},
		{
			"type": "text",
			"value": " to a file. Here is a "
		},
		{
			"type": "noddityTemplate",
			"file": "template.md",
			"children": [
				{
					"type": "noddityTemplateVariable",
					"value": "template.md"
				},
				{
					"type": "noddityTemplateVariable",
					"value": "cars"
				},
				{
					"type": "noddityTemplateVariable",
					"name": "wheels",
					"value": "2"
				}
			]
		},
		{
			"type": "text",
			"value": " with variables."
		}
	]
}
```

## Tree

These are the defined output node types.

#### `noddityLink`

This corresponds to the Noddity link syntax, and has these properties:

* `type = "noddityLink"` - The type.
* `file: String` - The file reference part of the link.
* `text?: String` - *(Optional)* The text part of the link, if present.

#### `noddityTemplate`

This corresponds to the Noddity template syntax, and has these properties:

* `type = "noddityTemplate"` - The type.
* `file: String` - The file reference part of the link.
* `children?: Array<noddityTemplateVariable>` - *(Optional)* An ordered array of defined variables.

#### `noddityTemplateVariable`

These are the variables used in the template syntax, they have these properties:

* `type = "noddityTemplateVariable"` - The type.
* `name?: String` - If this is a named variable, the name will be here.
* `value: String` - The value of the variable.

## To-Do

The to-markdown portion of this package is not yet available.

I don't have any use for it, so I probably won't get around to adding it.

If you would like to implement it, pull requests will be accepted.
